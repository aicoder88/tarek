# Website Audit & Fixes (2025-09-29)

## ✅ COMPLETED (MUST FIX Items)

### 1. ✅ Create missing `/about` page
**Status:** FIXED
**Location:** `app/[locale]/about/page.tsx`
- Created full About page with company values, team section, and stats
- Includes proper i18n support
- Uses existing translations from messages/en.json

### 2. ✅ Create missing `/contact` page
**Status:** FIXED (Not needed)
**Solution:** Contact link now points to `#contact` anchor on homepage
- Contact section already exists on homepage with full form
- Navigation updated to scroll to contact section

### 3. ✅ Fix file upload in contact form
**Status:** FIXED
**Location:** `src/components/contact/ContactForm.tsx`
**Changes:**
- Removed all file upload functionality (state, handlers, UI)
- Removed Upload, FileImage, X icons from imports
- Removed file-related email parameters
- EmailJS doesn't support file attachments, so this was misleading UX

### 4. ✅ Add .env.local to .gitignore
**Status:** FIXED
**Location:** `.gitignore`
**Changes:**
- Added explicit .env file patterns
- Added Next.js specific ignores (.next/, out/, build)
- Ensures EmailJS keys and other secrets are not committed

### 5. ✅ Fix ProjectGallery integration styling
**Status:** FIXED
**Location:** `src/components/projects/ProjectGallery.tsx`, `src/components/home.tsx`
**Changes:**

---

## 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY (Should Fix Soon)

### 7. Service Carousel UX Improvements
**Severity:** HIGH
**Location:** `src/components/services/ServiceGrid.tsx`
**Issues:**
- Carousel navigation arrows are oversized (h-20 w-20)
- Multiple redundant prompts to click arrows (lines 238, 241, 334)
- Over-designed with excessive animations
- No clear indication of total services

**Recommendations:**
- Reduce arrow size to h-12 w-12 or h-14 w-14
- Remove duplicate "click arrows" prompts - keep only one subtle hint
- Simplify animations (remove animate-pulse, animate-bounce)
- Add clear service counter (e.g., "9 Services Available")

### 8. Add Theme Toggle Button
**Severity:** MEDIUM-HIGH
**Status:** Missing feature
**Issue:** `next-themes` is installed and working, but no UI to switch themes
**Recommendation:**
- Add theme toggle button in Header (next to language selector)
- Use Sun/Moon icons from lucide-react
- Support system/light/dark modes

### 9. Mobile Navigation Spacing
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Location:** `src/components/layout/Header.tsx:165-174`
**Issue:** Mobile menu CTA button is too large, takes up excessive space
**Recommendation:**
- Reduce button size from `lg` to `default`
- Adjust padding in mobile menu container

### 10. Add Image Fallbacks
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Issue:** All images from external sources (Unsplash, Dicebear)
**Risks:**
- No fallback if external services fail
- No local image optimization
- Potential 404 errors

**Recommendations:**
- Add fallback images in `/public/images/`
- Use Next.js Image component with proper error handling
- Consider hosting critical images locally
- Add loading states

### 11. Sanitize Form Inputs
**Severity:** MEDIUM (Security)
**Location:** `src/components/contact/ContactForm.tsx:363-389`
**Issue:** User input sent directly to email without sanitization
**Risk:** Email injection attacks
**Recommendation:**
- Add input sanitization before sending to EmailJS
- Escape HTML characters
- Validate email format server-side if possible
- Add rate limiting

---

## 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY (Nice to Have)

### 12. Logo Dark Mode Enhancement
**Severity:** LOW
**Location:** `src/components/layout/Header.tsx:53`
**Issue:** Logo uses `brightness-110` filter in dark mode
**Recommendation:**
- Provide separate logo file for dark mode
- Use Next.js Image component with theme-aware src switching
- Remove brightness filter for professional appearance

### 13. Dynamic Stats Configuration
**Severity:** LOW
**Location:** `src/components/home.tsx:171-203`
**Issue:** Stats (15+ years, 500+ projects) are hardcoded
**Recommendation:**
- Move stats to configuration file or CMS
- Add to translation files for easy updates
- Consider making them dynamic/real-time

### 14. Before/After Slider UX
**Severity:** LOW
**Location:** `src/components/projects/ProjectGallery.tsx:146-225`
**Issues:**
- Not obviously draggable on desktop
- Touch controls may not be intuitive on mobile
- No usage instructions

**Recommendations:**
- Add visual hint (e.g., "Drag to compare" text)
- Add animated cursor hint on hover
- Improve mobile touch handling
- Add keyboard support (arrow keys)

### 15. Service Detail Pages Enhancement
**Status:** Pages exist but may need improvement
**Location:** `app/[locale]/services/*/page.tsx`
**Recommendation:**
- Verify all service pages use translations properly
- Ensure consistent layout across all service pages
- Add service-specific content (pricing estimates, timelines, FAQs)

### 16. Phone Number Consistency
**Location:** Header, Contact Form, Footer
**Current:** +1 438 226 3391
**Status:** COMPLETED ✅
**Changes Made:**
- Updated phone number in all translation files (en.json, fr.json, ar.json)
- Updated phone number in all React component files
- Updated phone number in all data files
- Updated tel: href links to +14382263391
- Phone number is now consistent across all locales

---

## 🟢 LOW PRIORITY (Future Enhancements)

### 17. Blog Implementation
**Status:** Navigation entry exists, no implementation
**Location:** `messages/en.json:8` (navigation.blog)
**Recommendation:**
- Remove from navigation OR implement blog
- If implementing: use MDX or headless CMS
- Add blog listing and detail pages

### 18. Projects Page
**Status:** No dedicated projects page
**Current:** Only embedded gallery on homepage
**Recommendation:**
- Create `/projects` route
- Use existing ProjectGallery with `embedded={false}`
- Add filtering, pagination
- Add project detail pages

### 19. Complete Translation Coverage
**Location:** Various components
**Issue:** Some text hardcoded instead of using translations
**Examples:**
- ServiceGrid carousel instructions (lines 238-239, 334)
- Stats labels in home.tsx

**Recommendation:**
- Audit all components for hardcoded text
- Move to translation files
- Run translation validation script

### 20. Service Detail Templates
